Portfolio page

## Description
In this assignment we were tasked with creating a portfolio page that is reactive as well as serves as a good reference for future potential employers.

### Reactive elements
`<nav>` I added elemnts to the navigational buttons at the top of the page so that in addition to pulling the page to the designated location on the page the cooresponding button will change color to red and also slightly increase in size.
// The same properties were added to the github link in the Contacts section.

`#Work` I added cards that will represent my work that will be link in those locations in the future. in addition i added properties to these cards that allow them to become higlighted with a red shadow whenever they are hovered over. 

//Also added flex boxes to most elemnts in the css file so that the webpage can fit onto a mobile webpage with little issue.
